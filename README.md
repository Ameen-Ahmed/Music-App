# SongSearch

This project is a Windows desktop application that searches several different music
providers for a song using the song name and/or artist name. The application was built
in Python, with the .exe file created using PyInstaller. Currently, the supported music 
providers include YouTube, SoundCloud, and Audiomack. Any recent searches are cached in a 
temporary file called "cache.db".

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This application requires a Windows operating system to function.
However, only Windows 10 compatability has been confirmed as of now.


### Installing 

To install this application, simply download the .exe file 
from inside the dist/ directory. Then open the .exe file.
